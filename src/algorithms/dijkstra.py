"""
Dijkstra Algorithm Implementation for Flight Route Optimization
Updated to work with processed flight data and discount system

The graph data is available in: graph_dijkstra.json
Format: {source_city: {dest_city: discounted_weight, ...}, ...}

Key Points:
- All weights are post-discount prices (IndiGo 15%, Jet Airways 20%, Credit Card ‚Çπ1000, Seasonal 25%)
- Dijkstra works well since all weights are positive after discount processing
- Serves as baseline to compare against Bellman-Ford results
- Expected routes: BLR‚ÜíDEL (‚Çπ2,265), BOM‚ÜíHYD (‚Çπ883.50), etc.
